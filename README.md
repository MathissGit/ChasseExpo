# Welcome to our ChasseExpo app

This project is an application created for the purpose of a treasure chest within our school.
It was necessary to create a mobile application using the technology of our choice (React Native with Expo here) and to implement features such as sending photos and messages in a Firebase Cloud.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```
